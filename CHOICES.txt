CHOICES

First Choice: Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes.
Second Choice: Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: Approach Danny
Fourth Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fifth Choice: Listen in on what they're saying
Sixth Choice: Approach Billy
Seventh Choice: Listen in on what he's saying
Eighth Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Ninth Choice: Talk to them directly
Tenth Choice: Seriously, where did this Doctor even come from? Isn't it pretty suspicious that he ran in just after Mr. Body was murdered? It must've been him. Accuse him.
